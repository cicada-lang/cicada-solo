title: "Recess: A Forkful of Pie"

Using Pie is very much like a conversation:
it accepts claims, definitions, and expressions
and it replies with feedback.

What sort of feedback?

For claims and definitions, the feedback is
whether they are meaningful.

For expressions, the feedback is also
the expression's type and normal form.

What if they are not meaningful?

Pie explains what is wrong with them,
and sometimes adds a helpful hint.

- Xie: A type system interact with people by providing feedback about ones reasoning.
  It is upon this feedback, we design the user experience of our services.

  - Good error messages.
  - Let the checker explain the process of its type checking.
