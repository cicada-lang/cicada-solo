Using Pie is very much like a conversation:
it accepts claims, definitions, and expressions
and it replies with feedback.

What sort of feedback?

whether they are meaningful.

For expressions, the feedback is also
the expression's type and normal form.

What if they are not meaningful?

Pie explains what is wrong with them,
and sometimes adds a helpful hint.

What might be wrong with an expression?
