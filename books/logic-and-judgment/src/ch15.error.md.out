I infer the type to be:
  Vector(E, j)
But the expected type is:
  Vector(E, j1)

ch15.error.md:
 30 |      //   - Pie ensures this by adding a `renaming` argument to all type checking functions,
 31 |      //     and use `reanming` during `readback`.
 32 |      //   - I handle this by using `subst` to rename bound variables.
