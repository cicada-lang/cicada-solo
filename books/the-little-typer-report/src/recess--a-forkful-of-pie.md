# Using Pie

- Using Pie is very much like a conversation:
  it accepts claims, definitions, and expressions
  and it replies with feedback.

- What sort of feedback?

- For claims and definitions, the feedback is
  whether they are meaningful.

  For expressions, the feedback is also
  the expression's type and normal form.

- What if they are not meaningful?

- Pie explains what is wrong with them,
  and sometimes adds a helpful hint.

- What might be wrong with an expression?

这里的叙述是形成「故事」的典范。
良好的用户接口和用户体验，可以在这种叙述中设计出来。
