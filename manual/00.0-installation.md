Cicada Language is designed to be extremely accessible.

Code blocks embedded in Markdown file are interactive on our website.

Click the following code block, you will see a menu button,
which provides tools to `RUN` the code.

``` cicada
let greeting = "Hello, World!"

greeting
```

# Git-based Wiki System

And any Markdown file on GitHub or GitLab,
can be rendered as an article by [Readonly.Link](https://readonly.link/),
in which the cicada code blocks are interactive.

Thus our website can be viewed as a git-based wiki of books and articles,
by which we can share programs and formalized proofs.

# Command Line Tools

We also provide a set of command line tools.

The command line program is called `cic`,
you can install it using `npm` by the follow command:

``` bash
npm -g i @cicada-lang/cicada
```

After installed package, you can run `cic help` to see help messages.
