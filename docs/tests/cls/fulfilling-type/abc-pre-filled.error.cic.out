Found the identifier "b" in [142, 143], while expecting:
 "=":
     sequence_entry:let_the@39 -> (name: identifier)@40 ":"@41 (t: exp):operand@42 > "=" (exp: exp) optional 
 ",":
     zero_or_more:more@39 -> (head: property):field@42 > "," (tail: zero_or_more) 
 ",":
     optional:one@42 -> > "," 
 and so on ...
