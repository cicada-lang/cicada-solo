I found syntax error in file: abc-pre-filled.error.cic

 11 |abc: ABC(sole, 2) = {
 12 |  a: sole
 13 |  b: 2
 14 |  c: "c"
 15 |}
Found the identifier "b" in [160, 161], while expecting:
 "=":
     sequence_entry:let_the@41 -> (name: identifier)@42 ":"@43 (t: exp):operand@44 > "=" (exp: exp) optional 
 ",":
     zero_or_more:more@41 -> (head: property):field@44 > "," (tail: zero_or_more) 
 ",":
     optional:one@44 -> > "," 
 and so on ...
