I found syntax error in file: abc-pre-filled.error.cic

 11 |abc: ABC(sole, 2) = {
 12 |  a: sole
 13 |  b: 2
 14 |  c: "c"
 15 |}
Found the identifier "b" in [151, 152], while expecting:
 "=":
     sequence_entry:let_the@40 -> (name: identifier)@41 ":"@42 (t: exp):operand@43 > "=" (exp: exp) optional 
 ",":
     zero_or_more:more@40 -> (head: property):field@43 > "," (tail: zero_or_more) 
 ",":
     optional:one@43 -> > "," 
 and so on ...
