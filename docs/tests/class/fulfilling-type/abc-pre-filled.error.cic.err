I am expecting the following two values to be the same String.
But they are not.

from given field value:
  "c"
to already fulfilled value:
  "d"

 20 |  e: String
 21 |}
 22 |
 23 |let abcde: ABCDE(Trivial, sole, "d") = {
 24 |  a: Trivial,
 25 |  b: sole,
 26 |  c: "c", // NOTE "c" is not equal to "d"
 27 |  d: "d",
 28 |  e: "e",
 29 |}
 30 |
 31 |compute abcde
