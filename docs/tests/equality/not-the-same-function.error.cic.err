I am expecting the following two values to be the same (_: String, _1: String) -> exists (_2: String) String.
But they are not.

from left hand side (from) of Equal:
  (x, y) => cons(x, y)
to right hand side (to) of Equal:
  (y, x) => cons(x, y)

docs/tests/equality/not-the-same-function.error.cic:
 3 |    (String) -> (String) -> Pair(String, String),
 4 |    (x, y) => cons(x, y),
 5 |    (y, x) => cons(x, y)),
 6 |  refl)
 7 |
