**Cicada Language** is a
*dependently typed programming language* and a
*interactive theorem prover*.

> The aim of cicada project is to help people understand that developing

I recommend a talk of Vladimir Voevodsky -- ["How I became interested in foundations of mathematics"](https://readonly.link/articles/github.com/xieyuheng/inner/-/persons/vladimir-voevodsky/how-i-became-interested-in-foundations-of-mathematics.md).

It summarises the motivation behind cicada project beautifully.
