> **This manual is currently under active development.**

**Cicada Language** is a
_dependently typed programming language_ and an
_interactive theorem prover_.

> The aim of cicada project is to help people understand that developing
> software and developing mathematics are increasingly the same kind of
> activity, and people who practices these developments, can learn from
> each other, and help each other in very good ways.

## The Little Typer

I learned about how to implement type system from Dan's little books.

My design of cicada language can be viewed as an exercise after "The Little Typer".

- Thanks, Daniel P. Friedman (1944 -), and David Thrane Christiansen,
  for your great dialogs and teachings.

## Vladimir Voevodsky's talk

I recommend a talk of Vladimir Voevodsky:

- ["How I became interested in foundations of mathematics"](https://readonly.link/articles/github.com/xieyuheng/inner/-/persons/vladimir-voevodsky/how-i-became-interested-in-foundations-of-mathematics.md)

It summarises the motivation behind cicada project beautifully.

- Thanks, Vladimir Voevodsky (1966 - 2017)
