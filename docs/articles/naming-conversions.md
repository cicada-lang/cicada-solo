# name of variable and function

In some case, we use type as postfix to name variable of this type.

- `nat_equal_consequence_t` -- `_t` for `Type`
- `incr_add1_equal` -- `_equal` for `Equal`

But in other case, we use type as prefix to name variable of this type.

- `nat_equal_consequence_same` -- `nat_equal_consequence_` for `nat_equal_consequence_t`
- `vec` & `vecnil` -- `vec` for `Vector`

We should improve the consistency of our naming conventions.
