# naming convention

## name of variable and function

- in some case, we use type as postfix to name variable of this type,
  - `nat_equal_consequence_t` -- `_t` for `Type`
  - `incr_add1_equal` -- `_equal` for `Equal`

- but in other case, we use type as prefix to name variable of this type,
  - `nat_equal_consequence_same` -- `nat_equal_consequence_` for `nat_equal_consequence_t`
  - `vec` & `vecnil` -- `vec` for `Vector`
