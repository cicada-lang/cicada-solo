title: About knowledge, logic, formal inference rule and computation
---

- knowledge := fixation of belief.

- belief := that upon which a man is prepared to act.

- logic := the system we use to express beliefs.

- judgment := an attitude that a person takes towards expressions.
  - when we come to know something, we are making a judgment.

- logic inference rule := formalized definition of judgment (belief).
  - by giving algorithm to check whether a group of data
    can be viewed as evidence of the judgment,
    which is the same as type checking algorithm.
  - introduction rule := use a group of data constructors to define a type constructor.
  - elimination rule := TODO
    - I do not understand the duality between introduction and elimination.
      - when introduction rules are given how to generate elimination rules?

- computation := directed changes (simulation of action).
  - computational model := rule about how to change the state in the next step.
    - examples: beta reduction of lambda calculus, turing machine.
  - program := carefully prepared init state.
