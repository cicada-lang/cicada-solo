  - maybe rename `BooleanLattice` to `BooleanAlgebra`,
    to be symmetric with `HeytingAlgebra`.

- [manual] [EWD1240a] A little bit of lattice theory

  - To test our system.
  - This paper is about the relation between PartialOrder and Lattice.
  - Learn from the story line for teaching.

# old

- merge `old/datatypes` to `manual/datatypes`

  - maybe need to design new syntax for natural deduction

- try to merge `old/langs` to `manual/langs`

  - take simply typed lambda calculus for example
