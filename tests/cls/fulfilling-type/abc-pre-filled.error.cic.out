I am expecting the following two values to be the same String.
But they are not.

from given field value:
  "c"
to already fulfilled value:
  "d"

abc-pre-filled.error.cic
 27 |  e: String
 28 |}
 29 |
 30 |abcde: ABCDE(sole, 2, "d") = {
 31 |  a: sole
 32 |  b: 2
 33 |  c: "c" // NOTE "c" is not equal to "d"
 34 |  d: "d"
 35 |  e: "e"
 36 |}
 37 |
 38 |abcde
